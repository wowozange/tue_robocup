Before Testing:
1: Be on the proper branches:
	- on ed_object_models -> branch: rgo2019_challenge_take_out_the_garbage
	- on challange_take_out_the_garbage -> branch: rgo2019_challenge_take_out_the_garbage
2: The drop area where the robot is going to drop the bag is the left side of the dinner table.
   So make sure that area is clear of any objects!

Instructions for testing:
1: Set the robot in the initial position, so in front of the imaginary door (in front of the sofa block)
2: Run challenge
3: Press emergency button when it is going to grab the trash bag! or remove bin.
   The distance is not tuned yet for this trash bin, so it will probably go wrong!!
   
ToDo's:
- add second trash bin, if we have a second trash bin.
  For now the second trash bin is the same as the first one.
- tune the correct distance for this trash bin
