RoboCup@Home Rulebook 2019, p46 - 5.1 Clean Up (Housekeeper)

Simplified Challenge description:
1. Start
2. Wait for info about the requested room to 'clean'
3. Move to the room
4. Visit each piece of furniture, seat, (including the floor!) to look for an object
5. Segment each camera snapshot and distinghuish between known and unknown objects. ('known' and 'unknown' depend on the
    set recognition threshold.
6. Keep a list of the 'known' objects
7. After all locations have been examined, move to the starting position in the room
8. Recite the list of objects frm the 'known-object' list
9. Leave the arena
10. End

Needed challenge_knowledge:
1. Layout of all the possible rooms
2. For each room: Some sort of shortest route to search the room furniture and the floor
3. Object knowledge (category/name) and required placement location for the objects



How to make challenge_knowledge?
- Arena layout (floorplan)                  (In robocup_knowledge-> environments-> <environment> -> common.py)
- Furniture objects with 'on_top_of' areas  (In ed_object_models-> models-> <environment> -> <object> -> model.yaml)
- Known objects                             (In cleanup.py)
- Challenge start/end point location        (In cleanup.py)
- Waypointlists to get to each room from the start point    (In common.py)
- Route (waypointlist?) within each room to cover the search area.  (In cleanup.py)

1. Start
   Load challenge knowledge (CK) from robocup_knowledge
2. Wait for info about the requested room to 'clean'
   Ask "Which room needs cleaning?"
   Loop until operator answer is understood
3. Move to the room via waypoints (CK) (robot_smach_states->navigation
   If needed wait for door to open, or let the robot do it
4. Loop through the list of waypoints for that room (CK)
    a. Take snapshot
    b. Analyse/Segment the snapshot
    c. Update lists of known/unknown objects (threshold dependant)
   Got next waypoint
5. If all waypoints are examined goto the starting point in the room
6. Report known objects to operator
7. Wait for 'continue'
8. Leave the arena area.
